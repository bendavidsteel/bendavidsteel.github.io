<div class="about">

	<p>Hey! <a href="https://www.are.na/block/2175395">Welcome to my little nook of the internet.</a> Here you'll find my write ups, rantings and wravings about anything that takes my interest.</p>
	<p>I'm currently really into public policy and political philosophy, but also love learning about music and science.</p>
    <p>I love climbing, cycling and backpacking, and also spend my 40 hours a week working as a software engineer.</p>
    <p>I grew up in the North East of England, and currently live in Montreal, Canada.</p>

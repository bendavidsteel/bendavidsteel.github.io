    <h1> A Gratitude Journal </h1>
    Date: 18/12/21
    I'm grateful for my partner, who is so smart, thoughtful, kind, spontaneous and just wonderful.
    I'm grateful to have the chance to get paid to work on something that is so absurdly meaningful, sophisticated, impactful and futuristic.
    I'm grateful for my upbringing and my parents, who've supported me always, constantly being understanding and given me a grounding to set forth into life.

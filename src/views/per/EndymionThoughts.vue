    I'm reading the 3rd book in that series by that guy who's obsessed with john keats
    And there's a weird af relationship where like there's this 27 year old guy who's meant to be like a guardian to this 10 year old girl
    And the framing of the novel is that he's telling the story from when he's old
    And in the old bits he's referencing how later they fall in love and fuck a lot
    But like in the here and now there's these weird bits where he's like seeing her naked and having descriptive thoughts but is explicitly like 'not in a paedophile way'
    And also she just had this weird prescient bit where she thinks she's older and that they're currently in love
    So i guess less weird than like jacob from twilight
    But still weird
    Partner: Really pushing the bounds of what it means to lust after a child in "not a paedophile way"

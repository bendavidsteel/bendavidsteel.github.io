        so like u have this dream where u meet dolores dei, who is like this kinda psuedo patron saint of the moralist movement, and is a big deal for this coalition called the moral international which is kinda like the un. but then over the course of the conversation u gradually realise that actually dolores dei is your ex, and you're reliving the moment where she leaves for a different continent
        and the writing is just heartbreakingly sad
        but like it's cool bc you've forgotten your ex as part of your amnesia so dolores is like the stand in in your mind
        oh well my point about it is that i love the way it doesn't allow you to do certain things and replicates how like someone with a mental illness or addiction just really can't do something
        and actually i think that maybe disco elysium could've done more in that regard
        like sometimes there are skill checks where you're trying to stop yourself from doing something
        like at one point you kinda accidently call your ex, and when you hear her voice your only options are to either like pathetically respond, or you can do a skill check to hang up then
        and i feel like that's such a good representation of knowing something isn't good for you but not just being able to like 'just don't do it and do good stuff instead'
        but i think they should have used that mechanic in more sections bc i think it was really effective
        especially playing a character who has literally been a lifelong drunk
        like i think my harry du bois kinda recovered too easily, the only nudges i got were my electrochemical system telling me to do stuff but not like giving me no other option other than a hard skill check
        oh also that's why i think the game having really strong political themes is so effective, bc it kinda forces you into this headspace of sadness about the world
        and like how nothing ever really works or makes everyone happy
        which i think makes young middle class people like me be more able to relate someone who is older and everything is going wrong around them and they feel like everything is out of their hands
        i know this is cringe

        <p>What events can we predict? Certainly many events are predictable, or so we may think with perfect hindsight. Elections are commonly predicted 
        from polling data. Oil crashes could be predicted by news articles. But could a revolution be predicted from social media data?</p>
        <p>Asimov portrays the field of psychohistory, a prescient combination of history, sociology, and statistics, echoing the burgeoning field of machine learning in use today.
        In the Foundation series, psychohistory is used to predict the impending and almost unavoidable collapse of a galatic empire.
        But the machine learning of today falls far short of this future science, and increasingly disappoints. Worse still, machine learning's heavy reliance
        on historical events to predict future ones puts its ability to predict these rare black swan style events in doubt.</p>
        <p>An exploration of chaos and complexity could reveal the potential predictability of these events, but the actual means of prediction is clearly 
        not yet here.</p>
        <p>More to come soon</p>

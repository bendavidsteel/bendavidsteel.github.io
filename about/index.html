	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>I became interested in software development in high school, after I taught myself python, although initially went to University of Bristol to study Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
     After my exchange year at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, I realised my true interests lay in software development (after a brief stint trying out neuroscience),
     and switched to Computer Science and Electronics. I'm currently in my fourth year in my integrated BEng and MEng course, and eagerly anticipating my career's future!
	 </p>
	<p>In my free time I enjoy climbing and cycling in and around Bristol. I enjoy longer backpacking and mountaineering adventures on my holidays.
	You might just also find me windsurfing on the weekends, if the wind's blowing...</p>

	<h3>My Skills</h3>
	<p>I love getting stuck into new projects, and am always eager to learn new skills.
	I have great experience writing in Python, Java and MATLAB, for school/personal projects and work experience.
	I can also write in C/C++, Bash, HTML and CSS. <br/>
	My degree has given me ability in electronics and digital design (VHDL) as well.
	I have experience working in industry from my summer internship in Control Techniques,
	and in research teams from my experience in the BIAPT Lab at McGill.<br/>
	On top of this I have learned many organisational and leadership skills from my 
	time on committee of university societies.</p>

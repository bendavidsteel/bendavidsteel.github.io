I taught myself python in high school, although initially went to University of Bristol to study Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
After my exchange year at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, I realised my true interests lay more towards software development (after a brief stint trying out neuroscience),
and switched to Computer Science and Electronics. I'm currently in my fourth year in my integrated BEng and MEng course, and eagerly anticapting my career's future!
In my free time I enjoy climbing, windsurfing, cycling, and other outdoorsy pursuits.
